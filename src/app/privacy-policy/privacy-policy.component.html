            INFORMATION WE COLLECT

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy only applies to information that we collect through the
            Peersview Online Interface (the &quot;Site,&quot; which consists of all content and pages
            located within the Peersview.com web domain and mobile application).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>&quot;Personal Identifiable Information&quot;</strong> means any information about yourself
            that you may provide to us when using the Peersview Service, such as when you
            sign up for a user account, update or change information for your account,
            register through or otherwise grant access to a third-party website such as
            Facebook or Google, subscribe to a Peersview Digital Campus Service,
            complete a survey, participate in public forums or enter into a transaction
            through the Site, which may include (but is not limited to) your name, contact
            information, gender, photo, date of birth, location, billing information, and
            occupation. We may receive Personally Identifiable Information when you send

        <p>
            <strong>“Non-Personal Information”</strong> means information that cannot be used to
            directly identify you. When users come to our Site, we may track, collect and
            aggregate Non-Personal Information indicating, among other things, what
            services users access most often, the order in which they were accessed, when
            they were accessed, and which hyperlinks were &quot;clicked.&quot; We also collect
            information from the URLs from which you linked to our Site. Collecting such
            information may involve logging the IP address, operating system and browser
            software used by each user of the Site session sources, and other data which
            tracks users&#39; access to the Services. Although such information is not Personally
            Identifiable Information, we may be able to determine from an IP address a
            user’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point
            of connectivity.

        <p>
            Peersview may collect and use any user data you upload to the Peersview

            audio file, audio-visual file, software or any other material uploaded to the
            Services. When you access our Services by or through a mobile device, we may
            receive or collect and store unique identification numbers associated with your

            operating system brand and model, depending on your mobile device settings,
            your geographical location data. You may be able to change the settings on your
            computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with any location
            information.
