    These are information that cannot be used to directly identify you. When users come to our Site, we may track, collect and aggregate Non-Identifiable Information indicating, among other things, what services users access most often, the order in which they were accessed, when they were accessed, and which hyperlinks were "clicked."

    We also collect information from the URLs from which you linked to our Site. Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address, operating system and browser software used by each user of the Site session sources, and other data which tracks users' access to the Services. Although such information is not Personally Identifiable Information, we may be able to determine from an IP address a user&rsquo;s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. Peersview may collect and use any user data you upload to the Peersview network whether it is in the form of opinion, a forum post or other text, image, audio file, audio-visual file, software or any other material uploaded to the Services.

<p>
    When you access our Services by or through a computer, phone, or other devices, we may receive or collect and store such device information depending on the permissions you&rsquo;ve granted.
